    "content_text": "Children can claim damages for 'lost years' caused by medical negligence, Supreme Court rules - paving the way for multi-million-pound pay outs\nThe decision comes more than four decades after a Court of Appeal judgment stating children cannot receive damages under the law.\nWednesday 18 February 2026 18:34, UK\nChildren can receive damages for the years of their life that will be lost because of medical negligence, the Supreme Court has ruled.\nThe decision by the UK's highest court overturns a legal ruling from 45 years ago and could lead to the NHS having to pay millions of pounds to patients harmed by botched procedures.\nA 1981 Court of Appeal judgment stated children cannot receive damages despite adults and teenagers being allowed to do so under the law.\nIt found that children could not receive damages on the basis they did not have any \"dependants\".\nBut the Supreme Court's ruling in London on Wednesday said this was \"incorrect\" and was \"inconsistent…with legal principle\".\nThe decision comes after a child, known only as CCC, sued Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in 2020.\nCCC was diagnosed with cerebral palsy following a severe brain injury, which was caused by clinical negligence by the trust and left the child requiring 24-hour care.\nIn the High Court ruling in 2023, Mr Justice Ritchie said that CCC suffered a severe shortage of oxygen to the brain before and during her birth, which caused cerebral palsy, with her life expectancy reduced to 29.\nMr Justice Ritchie awarded CCC a total of £6,866,615, which included the costs of care and equipment, but declined to order that the trust pay \"lost years\" damages, stating that he was \"bound\" by the 1981 Court of Appeal decision.\nRead more from Sky News:\nBig fall in household energy bills predicted from April\nWarmer weather is on its way to the UK, say forecasters\nCCC's mother then took the case to the Supreme Court on behalf of the child, with the challenge heard over two days in February last year.\nBy a four-to-one majority, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal and ordered that the case be sent back to the High Court so \"lost years\" damages could be assessed.\nIn his ruling, Lord Reed said \"whatever the age of the claimant\", the court has to \"assess just compensation as best it can on the material which is reasonably available\".\nFollowing the ruling, CCC's mother said: \"I feel elated that my little girl has changed the law and that this will help lots of other children who have been injured through no fault of their own.\"\nJane McNicholas, chief medical officer at the trust, said a review showed \"there were clearly aspects of the care which should have been done differently, and we are so very sorry that this happened\".",

That makes it even more rewarding.\"\nComing in second place were US skiers Ben Ogden and Gus Schumacher, who were just 1.4 seconds behind for the silver medal.\nSpeaking to journalists after the race, Schumacher said that he \"locked in\" - and followed Klaebo over the line.\n\"I did it, and I'm really proud of it,\" he said.\nRead more from Sky News:\nBritish man killed in avalanche in French Alps\nUkrainian officials to boycott Winter Paralympics\nWith 10 metres to go, he saw Ogden - now the US's most decorated male cross-country skier - across the finish line to greet him, and knew a medal was in hand, having beaten Italy's Federico Pellegrino.",

    "content_text": "Jose Mourinho sounded like he was victim blaming - but Vinicius Junior needs empathy over alleged racist abuse\nThe Brazilian, one of football's superstars, was allegedly racially abused more than once during a Champions League tie between Real Madrid and Benfica in Lisbon.\nWednesday 18 February 2026 19:01, UK\nVinicius Junior had every right to want to leave the pitch - and for the game to be abandoned.\nBecause while he is a superstar of the game, well used to the biggest Champions League occasions, being the target of racism cannot be excused as coming with football's tribalism.\nThis was reporting being racially abused at work. Just after adding another wondrous strike to his collection of goals.\nThe accused - Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni - has every right to a thorough process if he persists with denials.\nAnd the UEFA case has to be watertight before imposing the minimum 10-game ban for racism.\nBut Benfica have gone beyond defending their man with statements, showing no empathy with a player who has been singled out for hate because he is black too often in his career.\nThere has been no acknowledgement of how difficult it is to take a stand and report abuse, halting a match being watched worldwide by millions.\nThere has been no recognition of the anguish Vinicius will be feeling, even if, as a club, you do not believe he was called a monkey by Prestianni on Tuesday night in Lisbon - five times, according to his Real teammate Kylian Mbappe.\nYou can recognise that personal pain as a club without admitting wrongdoing.\nFor all the courage and dignity demonstrated by Vinicius - praised by his Brazilian FA bosses - there was only deflection and no compassion from Jose Mourinho and Benfica.\nThey only complained about facing a \"defamation campaign\", and appropriated the memory and legacy of Eusebio and the black superstar's legendary career with them in the 1960s and 70s as evidence that the club cannot be racist. That overlooked the racism Eusebio endured.\nHow does Benfica reaffirming their \"historical and unwavering commitment to defending the values of equality, respect, and inclusion\" align with victim blaming?\nMourinho suggested Vinicius incited the crowd with his goal celebration.\nAnd yet if there is anyone in football known for goading, overexuberant celebrations, it is Mourinho himself on the touchlines.\nUEFA has avoided saying anything beyond the appointment of an ethics and disciplinary inspector to investigate.\nBut FIFA President Gianni Infantino did speak out in a statement naming Vinicius, showing \"full solidarity to victims of racism and any form of discrimination\" and saying: \"We need all the relevant stakeholders to take action and hold those responsible to account.\"\nBut that did not happen when another Real Madrid player, Antonio Rudiger, reported being racially abused last year.\nIt was in the Club World Cup - a tournament run by FIFA. An investigation was launched, but no one was held to account.\nRead more on Sky News:\nUEFA investigates Vinicius allegations\nFans jailed for Vinicius racist abuse\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\nSo, when the world asks why racism is still a stain on the game, why black players fear being abused in stadiums and online, the words and actions of those with status and power come under greater scrutiny.\nAnd at the heart of it is Vinicius feeling he isn't being protected enough by football, and could have to face the alleged perpetrator next week in the second leg in Madrid.",
