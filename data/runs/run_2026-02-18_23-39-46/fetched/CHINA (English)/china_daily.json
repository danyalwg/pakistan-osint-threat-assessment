    "content_text": "Satellite lofted for first Arab country\nA Chinese-made communications satellite became the first \"export\" of such a spacecraft to an Arab country when it was launched by China on Monday for Algeria.\nA Long March 3B carrier rocket blasted off at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the southwestern province of Sichuan at 12:40 am. It soared for about 26 minutes before placing the Alcomsat-1, the Algeria's first communications satellite, into geostationary transfer orbit, according to a news release from China Great Wall Industry Corp, the project contractor.\nPresident Xi Jinping and his Algerian counterpart Abdelaziz Bouteflika exchanged congratulatory messages on Monday morning on the successful mission.\nIn his message, Xi said that the satellite project is an important manifestation of the China-Algeria comprehensive strategic partnership. It has become a good example of space cooperation between China and Arab countries and will play a significant role in promoting Algeria's economic and social development, he said.\nXi said that Beijing is willing to work with Algeria to strengthen exchanges and cooperation in various fields, deepening the bilateral partnership so as to benefit the two countries and peoples.\nBouteflika said that Alcomsat-1 is a remarkable achievement in space cooperation between the two countries and reflects the deep traditional friendship between the two sides. Algeria is willing to work with China to strengthen cooperation, he said.\nThe satellite contract was signed in December 2013 between the Algerian Space Agency and China Great Wall Industry Corp, the country's largest space contractor in the international market.\nAlcomsat-1 was designed and manufactured by the China Academy of Space Technology, part of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, based on the DFH-4 satellite platform.\nWith a liftoff weight of 5.2 metric tons and a designed life of 15 years, the satellite will be used for a wide variety of public services such as television broadcasting, emergency communications, remote education and satellite-based signal augmentation, according to Great Wall Industry.\nFu Zhiheng, vice-president of the company, said Alcomsat-1 is as good as Western communications satellites in terms of technology and capacity. He said there are other contracts between his firm and Arab countries, without elaborating.\nzhaolei@chinadaily.com.cn\n- China allocates 100m yuan for post-disaster recovery in flood-hit Guangdong\n- Notice calling for a halt to minors participating in food delivery services sparks debate\n- 1st anniversary of Badain Jaran World Heritage status celebrated\n- Former Guangxi official gets death with reprieve\n- New regulation asks officials to cut red tape, improve work efficiency\n- Nanjing debuts whimsical zoo-themed bus",

    "content_text": "Nanjing massacre remembered on 80th anniversary\nA memorial service to mark the 80th anniversary of the Nanjing Massacre committed by the Japanese military during World War II brought together hundreds of activists and members of the Chinese and other Asian communities on Sunday in San Francisco.\nThe memorial, organized by the Rape of Nanking Redress Coalition, the Committee to Promote Reunification of China, the Alliance for Preserving the Truth of Sino-Japanese War and Comfort Women Justice Coalition, has been held annually for the past 20 years with the aim of exposing the Japanese Imperial Army's war crimes and encouraging people to understand and never forget the dark chapter of history.\n\"The Japanese Army blatantly violated international conventions and committed the extremely cruel atrocity in Nanjing, where 300,000 Chinese civilians were murdered and one third of the buildings were destroyed,\" said Zha Liyou, acting Chinese consul general in San Francisco, at the service.\nJapanese troops captured Nanjing, which was China's capital at the time, on Dec 13, 1937, commencing a slaughter that lasted more than 40 days. Tens of thousands of women were raped.\n\"Our stories are linked. The fate of over 400,000 women sexually enslaved by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II is part and parcel of what happened during the Nanjing Massacre,\" said Judith Mirkinson, president of the Comfort Women Justice Coalition.\nShe said the 20th century has been called the most violent century in the history of the world, and that one way to ensure peace in the 21st century is through truth and reconciliation.\n\"Reconciliation does not come without truth. So the Japanese government must acknowledge their crimes,\" she said. \"They must give justice to those few people who still survive from the Nanjing Massacre and to the memory of what happened there.\"\nFrom the time that Japan invaded northeast China in September 1931, followed by a full-scale invasion that started on July 7, 1937, around 35 million Chinese soldiers and civilians were killed or injured during the Japanese occupation, which continued until 1945.\nTo honor the victims and the survivors, and to pursue justice and an enduring peace, the Chinese community worldwide joined hands this year to commemorate this historic event which was designated by the Chinese government as National Memorial Day for Nanjing Massacre Victims.\n\"To remember the atrocities committed by the Japanese Army during World War II does not mean to pass on the enmity but rather to remind people not to forget the history and inspire them to love peace,\" said Zha. \"It might be a comfort to the victims and those who sacrificed their lives that the Nanjing Massacre has been etched into the memory of the Chinese people and the world civilization.\"\nThe Nanjing Massacre was entered onto the UNESCO Memory of the World Register, a compendium aimed at preserving documented heritage of universal value, in 2015.\nliazhu@chinadailyusa.com",

Her Chinese name is Sui Yuanjing. She started ballroom and Latin dancing four years ago and was partnered earlier this year with Francis, who lives in the English county of Shropshire.\nThe two were friends before they performed together and Kerry said their friendship is one of the best things about her dancing partnership with Francis.\nTheir hard work, under the guidance of teachers Laura O'Brien and David and Helen Truman, meant Kerry and Francis have seen quite a lot of success.\n\"When Francis is stressed, I can calm him down, because he hasn't really been in many big competitions, such as the nationals and internationals,\" Kerry said. \"My mum said I have to guide him.\"\nFrancis said Kerry has a positive attitude and described her as always remaining upbeat.\nAnd they both have a dance that they like the least: the tango.\n\"The tango is like an angry dance, you have to be sharp,\" Kerry said.\nThe dancers often visit each other's families and describe their friendship and their teachers' involvement as like being in a big family. She said a visit to China put a strain on the close bonds.\n\"I was in China for six weeks and there was a dance studio there where I would practice, but I felt lonely,\" Kerry said.\nFrancis described the time they spent apart as \"horrible\".\nKerry and Francis were training on Saturday in Wolverhampton, a city in England's West Midlands region, in advance of a competition in Stoke-on-Trent on Sunday. The event was cancelled due to the heavy snowfall across parts of the United Kingdom.\nThe pair head to Italy in January for a competition, before jetting off to China to appear on a TV show.",
