    "content_text": "FBR permits stranded Afghan transit shipments to move from Chaman and Quetta to ports\nStuck commercial goods will now be moved to the ports of Karachi\nThe Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has allowed the re-export of Afghan transit trade consignments, that had remained stranded for months at Chaman and Quetta, through Karachi's ports.\nThe main border crossings with Afghanistan have remained closed to regular trade and transit since October 10, 2025, following deadly clashes along the frontier after Kabul failed to stem terrorist attacks in Pakistan originating from its soil.\nOn Oct 16, the FBR officially suspended all Afghan Transit Trade operations from Karachi’s ports. All gate passes for Afghan transit consignments were cancelled and clearance of such cargo was halted at Karachi Port and Port Qasim.\nRead: K-P urges talks to revive Afghan border trade\nAlthough a ceasefire was discussed in talks hosted by Qatar and Turkiye, trade has not resumed since then. More than 10,000 Pakistani and Afghan traders, along with transit trade shipments, were reportedly stranded at Karachi port, resulting in losses amounting to billions of rupees.\nHowever, the FBR has now permitted the reverse movement and subsequent re-export of the stranded consignments in a notificated issued on Tuesday.\n“Reverse movement of all stranded Afghan transit trade cargo has been allowed for its subsequent re-export from Karachi port and Port Qasim Terminal,” said the notification issued by the Directorate of Transit Trade.\nAccording to the orders, commercial goods belonging to several countries that were stuck in Chaman and Quetta will now be moved to the ports of Karachi.\nThe notification directed concerned tracking and monitoring companies to end the trip of the stranded cargo at Halting Station, Chaman, and NLC Dry Port, Quetta, and then initiate the reverse movement from those stations to Karachi ports.\nThe FBR stated that the reverse movement of transit trade goods would be carried out in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations. For the transportation of transit goods from the borders, bonded carriers would be required to submit applications to the FBR.\nUnder the directives, one customs official will accompany every convoy of up to 15 vehicles during the transfer. “A sepoy shall be deputed with each convoy of up to 15 vehicles who will only be responsible to collect manual acknowledgment on manual transport notes for record,” the notification said.\nThe FBR further directed that tracking companies must submit certificates confirming that all monitoring devices were functional and that the consignment was “good to go”. It added that all payments related to tracking and monitoring devices for the reverse journey of each container must be fully cleared.\nA manual transport note will be issued for each bonded vehicle carrying transit trade goods, containing complete details of the vehicle and the driver. Each manual transport note will be signed by the sealing officer of the Directorate of Transit Trade, Quetta.\nContainers carrying transit goods will be cleared after thorough inspection by the customs department. The representative or bonded carrier will also issue a duly signed carrier manifest for each vehicle and certify in writing that the stranded cargo remained safe and that all seals are intact.\n“Customs staff at Quetta/Chaman will inspect PCCSS and shipper seals and if any seal is found to be tampered or broken, or where any discrepancy is observed in weight or scanning report, such consignment shall be subject to proper examination,” the notification stated.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",

    "content_text": "Pakistan 'won't hesitate' to carry out more air strikes in Afghanistan, says Khawaja Asif\nDefence minister says war with India remains 'a possibility' as New Delhi, Kabul align on striking Pakistan\nDefence Minister Khawaja Asif on Wednesday said Pakistan would not hesitate to conduct more air strikes in Afghanistan if no action was taken by Kabul against militants on its soil to ensure peace.\nThe federal government has been consistently raising its voice on international forums against terrorist sanctuaries operating in Afghanistan and using its soil to launch attacks on Pakistan — a development attested to by the United Nations Security Council.\nRecently, a suicide bomber struck the Imambargah Khadijah al-Kubra during Friday prayers in Islamabad, killing 36 people and injuring around 169 others. The attack was the deadliest in Islamabad in more than a decade and the deadliest nationwide since the Peshawar mosque bombing in January 2023.\nImmediately following the blast, raids were conducted in Nowshera and Peshawar, resulting in the arrest of four facilitators. The Daesh-linked mastermind, an Afghan national, was also captured. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi stated that the network behind the blast was trained in Afghanistan and that authorities had gathered intelligence on the suspects prior to the attack.\nIn an an interview with FRANCE 24 today on the entire situation, the defence minister said: \"Any attack in Pakistan, it has the blessings of Afghan government.\"\nQuestioned about alleged air strikes by Pakistan in Afghanistan last year and whether such an option was on the table again, Asif said: \"We always have that option and we can exercise that option. There is absolutely, we won't hesitate ... If someone in Kabul can underwrite peace, obviously there will be no hostilities, but they continue to patronise, continue to become co-conspirators. They have the control of the whole of Afghanistan. If these outfits are operating from their soil, they have the responsibility. They cannot deny the responsibility.\"\nIn August last year, Afghan officials claimed that two drone strikes had hit the house of a man in Shinwar district, Nangarhar province. The Afghan government had summoned Pakistan’s Ambassador in Kabul to lodge a formal protest against what it had claimed were Pakistani military strikes in Nangarhar and Khost provinces.\nIn November, the Afghan Taliban regime had again accused Pakistan of launching air strikes. Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said that Pakistan had \"bombed\" Afghanistan's Khost province and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika. In response, Pakistan had vehemently dismissed Kabul's allegations, insisting that Islamabad neither carried out covert cross-border operations nor targeted civilians.\nIn his interview, Asif further stated that all the terrorist factions currently operating in Afghanistan, including the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) Pakistan, TTP Afghanistan, Islamic State and Daesh, along with a dozen or more smaller groups, were present due to the attitude and non-seriousness of the Kabul government in curbing terrorism.\n\"They have actually provided them safe havens on their soil,\" Asif said.\nResponding to questions about India’s alleged involvement in supporting terrorists in Afghanistan, Asif said, “After the four-day conflict in May last year, India was badly beaten. Their humiliation on the international stage was clear after being defeated by a state much smaller in geography and even in army strength. Our air force practically decimated their attempts to invade Pakistan. As a result, India is now waging a proxy war against Pakistan.\"\nAsif added that India, along with Kabul and terrorist outfits operating in Afghanistan, were \"on the same page\".\n\"However, India will not accept this reality. How can you expect them to accept it? They will continue to deny it, but they have very good relations with Kabul. Now, we are facing a proxy war, and we will continue to deal with it.\"\nAlso Read: Security czar sees India's hand in series of attacks\nAsif said that Pakistan had no contact with India, direct or indirect. He said that war with India was still \"a possibility\" in such conditions.\n\"We approached friendly countries that tried to mediate between Pakistan and Afghanistan,\" he said. \"I’ve been part of attempts in Istanbul, Doha and even Kabul. But these attempts did not yield results. They acknowledged that TTP is operating from their territory and indirectly admitted they do not have control over them.\"\nHe added, \"We told them, then let us deal with them. Allow us to handle them if you can’t control them.\"\nPakistan’s contribution to Gaza Peace Board\nWhen asked about the potential for Pakistan to contribute to the Gaza Peace Board, Asif said he sees no problem with it, but it depended on the \"terms of reference\" for the peace force.\n“We have been participating for many years. Pakistan was the number one contributor to the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Africa, East Timor, Somalia, Congo, and multiple other locations. We have that experience,\" Asif said.\nHe continued, \"Gaza and Palestine are causes very close to our hearts, as they are for the people of Pakistan. We have shown solidarity with them for many decades.\" Asif stressed that Pakistan had consistently supported Palestine in all global forums. \"This is a good opportunity, and we hope it will bring us closer to achieving a two-state solution in the Middle East.\"\nOn the question of normalisation of relations between several Muslim countries and Israel, Asif said that he did see \"this option being even considered by Pakistan\" unless Palestinians were granted \"the right of self-determination in their own homeland\" within the framework of a two-state solution.\nRead More: Pakistan open to diplomacy, not war with Afghanistan\nOn the topic of Pakistan's political system, Asif reflected on the historical role of the military in politics, particularly during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\"There were times when the establishment intervened and took control. But that is not happening now,\" he said. \"The current situation, with the threat of terrorism from Afghanistan and India, and an economy that was in shambles three years ago, is different.\"\nAsif described the current system as a \"hybrid arrangement\", where national institutions, including the military, cooperated with the elected government.\n\"The armed forces are the most important national institution and they are helping the political government,\" he said. \"There is absolutely no military rule. My boss is the prime minister,\" Asif concluded.\nPakistan’s allegations against Afghanistan, India of supporting terrorism\nPakistan has repeatedly pointed to an Afghanistan–India nexus behind terrorism in the country.\nIn November 2024, Inter-Services Public Relations Director-General Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had issued a warning that the Afghan regime was a threat not just to Pakistan but to the entire region and the world, citing the abandonment of $7.2 billion worth of American military equipment during the US withdrawal.\nLt Gen Chaudhry reiterated that the Afghan regime was harbouring “Non-State Actors” who posed a threat to various countries in the region, noting the Taliban’s failure to establish an inclusive state and government post-2021. He stressed that Pakistan's issue was with the Afghan Taliban regime, not the Afghan people.\nRead More: Afghan regime poses threat to region, world: DG ISPR\nAfter the conflict with India in May 2025, Field Marshal Asim Munir had said that Pakistan would never be coerced, and that all inimical designs to derail the country's counterterrorism efforts would be “comprehensively defeated”.\nAlso Read: India's 'hydro terrorism' untenable: COAS\nHe had said Pakistan’s military remained prepared to respond across the full spectrum of conflict. He particularly criticised India’s growing tendency to resort to unprovoked military aggression, cautioning that strategic stability in South Asia was increasingly fragile and hinged on justice, especially in Kashmir.\nAfter recent terrorist attacks in Balochistan, Naqvi had once again blamed India for a coordinated terror campaign in the province.\n“These were not ordinary terrorists. India is behind these attacks. I can tell you for certain that India planned these attacks along with these terrorists,” he said.\nHe added that authorities would pursue every individual involved, as well as those directing them from behind the scenes.\nRead This: Security czar sees India's hand in series of attacks\nNaqvi further claimed that India was the “main country” behind terrorism, saying it not only provides financial support to terrorists but also assists them in planning and strategising.\nIn 2023, a UN report also revealed that the TTP had established a new base in K-P in mid-2023. The report shed light on close ties not only between the TTP and the Afghan Taliban but also with anti-Pakistani groups and al Qaeda.\nRead This: The breeding ground for terror\nThe report further revealed that some Taliban members had also joined the TTP, perceiving it as a religious obligation to provide support.\nInterlocutors reported that TTP members and their families received regular aid packages from the Taliban.\nImportantly, the UN report noted a significant increase in Afghan nationals in the TTP ranks. This supported Pakistan’s stance that a growing number of Afghan nationals were involved in suicide attacks in the country.\nMore recently, a UNSC report said that attacks on Pakistan by the TTP from Afghanistan have increased, endorsing Islamabad's long-running complaints about militant sanctuaries across the border. The 37th report by the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, dated February 4, not only endorsed Islamabad's stance that Afghanistan had become a sanctuary for militants who used its territory to launch attacks on Pakistan, but also came at a time when the country is facing a renewed spate of violence.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
